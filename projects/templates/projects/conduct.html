            <p> 
                PSoC is dedicated to providing a positive and harassment-free event experience for everyone,
                regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal
                appearance, body size, ethnicity, race, religion, nationality, or level of experience. We do not 
                tolerate harassment of event participants in any form, nor do we tolerate any behavior that would 
                reasonably lead to another event participant being made to feel unsafe, insecure, or frightened for 
                their physical or emotional well-being. All communication should be appropriate for a professional 
                audience including people of many different backgrounds.
